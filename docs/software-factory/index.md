## Summary

A “software factory” is an organized approach to software development that provides software design and development teams a repeatable, well-defined path to create and update software. It results in a robust, compliant, and more resilient process for delivering applications to production.

A software factory combines tools, teams, and practices to organize, standardize, store, and reuse code, enabling teams to efficiently build upon accumulated knowledge. Both developers and software architects benefit from a more organized and structured approach, while your entire organization benefits from faster software delivery and higher quality code.

## What

- Reference and informational elements. Which resources will you provide? Consider creating guidelines for starting new applications, how-to topics, and examples of completed projects. These are also useful for training and orientation. (Backstage)
- Templates. Templates are premade application elements with placeholders. They can accelerate and simplify project startup. (Backstage)
- Software design. What tools or methods will you use to model applications at a higher level of abstraction? (draw.io)
- Tooling. Which development tools will you offer as part of your software factory (devcontainers)
- Configuration management software for establishing repeatable infrastructure (ansible, terraform, peluma)
- Continuous integration (build and test) systems (Jenkins, Gitlab)
- Source code repositories (git)
- Issue tracking systems
- Container driven tools (container repository)
- Integrated development environment (IDE) (vscode)





## Backstage
Tool to provide configuration managed project templates configured to the software factory.

Searchable catalogue of libraries, solutions, data sources and their related technical documentation. It also houses standards and how to guidance.
