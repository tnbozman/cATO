# Getting Started

To get started from the ground up you need to learn about containerisation.

To do this it is recommended you obtain an O'Reilly subcription as we will use information freely available on the web or within O'Reilly.

# Environment

To get started you need Kubernetes as it is a foundational skill to achieving cATO.
For now we will limit ourselves to MiniKube to achieve a Kubernetes installation.

As containerisation requires linux you will install Minikube on a linux vm. 
To achieve this for windows more details are provided at [Ubuntu VM on Linux](./hyper-v-ubuntu/).
